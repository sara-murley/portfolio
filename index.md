## About Me

I am passionate about using data science and quantitative analysis to make the health care system more affordable and effective. Coming from a mathematics background, I enjoy breaking down complex problems into clear, logical components. I am driven by a desire to understand why health care in the United States is so expensive and how policy can better address the underlying drivers of those costs, particularly in areas like prescription drug pricing, provider incentives, and market structure. 

As a Data Science for Public Policy student at Georgetown University, I am building expertise in machine learning, causal inference, and applied analytics through projects such as those showcased here. My work experience across private, public, academic, and nonprofit settings has shaped how I connect technical analysis to practical policy questions. 

I am seeking roles that allow me to deepen my health policy expertise while continuing to build on my strong quantitative foundation. I am especially interested in positions where I can turn complex analysis into actionable insights for policymakers.
