This project develops and evaluates machine learning models using CMS Medicare Part D data to predict prescribers with a preference for brand-name drugs, with XGBoost emerging as the top-performing model after prioritizing recall to better capture high brand-name prescribers. Model interpretation using SHAP and feature importance reveals that higher beneficiary risk scores, provider specialty, and pharmaceutical industry payments are consistent drivers of brand-name prescribing, highlighting policy opportunities for risk-adjusted benchmarking, specialty-specific guidance, and enhanced transparency.

**Methods:** Supervised machine learning, model tuning and performance evaluation, model interpretability and validation   
**Tools:** Python, ML model libraries (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)   
**Data:** Public CMS Data (Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use Files, Open Payments)
