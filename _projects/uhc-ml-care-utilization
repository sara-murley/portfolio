This project applied machine learning and advanced AI techniques to predict patient healthcare utilization and spending. Using claims, provider, and diagnosis data, we clustered similar patients, forecasted hospitalizations, and identified high-spending beneficiaries. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed in R, models were trained and tested in PyTorch, and visualizations were created with Tableau. Results and actionable insights were presented to leadership in Chile (en español), helping inform strategies to connect patients with appropriate care and reduce preventable hospitalizations.

**Methods:** Data cleaning, clustering, predictive modeling, visualization  
**Tools:** R, Python (PyTorch), Tableau  
**Data:** Patient claims, provider, and diagnosis data  

**Note:** Work contributed to UnitedHealthcare analytics efforts; data and models are not publicly available.
