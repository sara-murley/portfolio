Georgetown University | PPOL 5205 Advanced Modeling Techniques | September 2025 - December 2025

This project applies topic modeling to large-scale Reddit discussions of Medicare and Medicaid to examine administrative burden and user experience with the programs. The analysis shows that Medicaid-related burden is driven primarily by eligibility verification, documentation requirements, and caregiving responsibilities, while Medicare-related burden centers on navigation challenges, cost management, and plan selection. The project includes an interactive chatbot interface that connects users to relevant resources and similar discussions based on predicted topic probability distributions. 

**Methods:** Natural Language Processing, Clustering, Topic Modeling   
**Tools:** Python  
**Data:** Reddit data collected via public APIs
