Georgetown University | Research Assistant to Professors Kelemen & Pavone | September 2024 - present

This project applies a lexicon-based sentiment analysis pipeline to over 4,000 law review articles. The approach combines web scraping, natural language processing, and multi-lexicon sentiment scoring, adapted from [MultiLexScaled](https://github.com/amaurits/MultiLexScaled) and refined with EU law experts to accurately capture sentiment toward the EU legal order and the European Court of Justice. Analyses examine shifts in sentiment over time, across author affiliations, and across subject areas. Future work will focus on validation and expanding the pipeline to additional journals. 

**Methods:** Web scraping, natural language processing, lexicon-based sentiment analysis   
**Tools:** Python    
**Data:** Articles and commentaries from the *Common Market Law Review*

**Note:** This page highlights my contribution to the forthcoming project “In the Mood for Law: Shifting Sentiments of Legal Scholars About the EU Legal Order” led by Tommaso Pavone, R. Daniel Kelemen & Mauricio Mandujano Manriquez. The full manuscript and code are not publicly available at this time.
