This project models prescription stimulant use and abuse among college students using an SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered) framework. We applied epidemiology and differential equation theory to represent how stimulants spread in the student population to inform prevention strategies. The approach includes defining population classes, estimating transition rates between stages, and analyzing relapse and recovery dynamics. We designed and deployed a survey to collect data, and calibrated the MATLAB model using both survey input and guidance from addiction experts and prior literature. 

**Methods:** Differential equation modeling, SEIR epidemiological framework, survey design 
**Tools:** MATLAB, Python  
**Data:** Survey responses from college students on stimulant use

**Note:** This research was conducted under the supervision of Dr. Skylar Grey at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Experimental Mathematics Lab.
