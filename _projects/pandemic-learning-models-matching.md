This project examines Pennsylvania school districts with similar characteristics but varying COVID-19 policies to assess the impact of in-person instruction during the 2020–2021 school year on educational outcomes. Using district-level data, the study applied statistical matching to compare districts with different degrees of in-person instruction and analyzed standardized test scores before and after the pandemic. The analysis shows that districts with more in-person instruction experienced significantly smaller declines in Math test scores, highlighting the potential academic benefits of in-person learning during pandemic-related disruptions.

**Methods:** Matched difference-in-differences, OLS regressions, paired t-tests
**Tools:** R (MatchIt library), Python  
**Data:** Publicly available district-level data from Future Ready PA, Digital Bridge K-12, COVID-19 School Data Hub, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
