# Projects

This section contains selected academic and applied data science projects focused on public policy. 
Each project description notes methods used and the availability of data and code. 

## Academic Projects

### Administrative Burden in Public Health Insurance Programs: Evidence from Reddit Post Topic Modeling
*Georgetown University | PPOL 5205 Advanced Modeling Techniques | September 2025 - December 2025*

This project applies topic modeling to large-scale Reddit discussions of Medicare and Medicaid to examine administrative burden and user experience with the programs. The analysis shows that Medicaid-related burden is driven primarily by eligibility verification, documentation requirements, and caregiving responsibilities, while Medicare-related burden centers on navigation challenges, cost management, and plan selection. The project includes an interactive chatbot interface that connects users to relevant resources and similar discussions based on predicted topic probability distributions. 

**Methods:** Natural Language Processing, Clustering, Topic Modeling   
**Tools:** Python   
**Data:** Reddit data collected via public APIs

### Predicting Medicare Prescribing Patterns
*Georgetown University | PPOL 5204 Applied Statistical Learning| January 2024 - May 2024*

This project develops and evaluates machine learning models using CMS Medicare Part D data to predict prescribers with a preference for brand-name drugs, with XGBoost emerging as the top-performing model after prioritizing recall to better capture high brand-name prescribers. Model interpretation using SHAP and feature importance reveals that higher beneficiary risk scores, provider specialty, and pharmaceutical industry payments are consistent drivers of brand-name prescribing, highlighting policy opportunities for risk-adjusted benchmarking, specialty-specific guidance, and enhanced transparency.

**Methods:** Supervised machine learning, model tuning and performance evaluation, model interpretability and validation   
**Tools:** Python, ML model libraries (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)   
**Data:** Public CMS Data (Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use Files, Open Payments)
